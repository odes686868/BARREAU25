/*
  # Restore Stripe Integration Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `stripe_customers`: Links Supabase users to Stripe customers
    - `stripe_subscriptions`: Manages subscription data
    - `stripe_orders`: Stores order/purchase information

  2. Views
    - `stripe_user_subscriptions`: Secure view for user subscription data
    - `stripe_user_orders`: Secure view for user order history

  3. Security
    - Enables Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
    - Implements policies for authenticated users to view their own data
